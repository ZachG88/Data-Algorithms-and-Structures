# CSE373
Code portions to all CSE 373 work

A few things to read before donloading/editing the code:

There is no guarentee that this code is 100% correct. It got us through the course and passing the test cases,
but it is not a faultless template for how you should complete the projects.

Dont copy this code. It should be used as a reference, but I challenge you to find more effecient methods
for writing the code. 

Let me know if there is anything I can help clear up if you run into any obstacles.
